Shag Rock is a very early-stage band making their debut in Australia playing small festivals and venues all along the coast.

I first discovered Shag Rock when on vacation in Gold Coast, Australia. I was staying with a friend in a very lively town called Surfer's Paradise where every fall they held a music festival called Surfer's Paradise LIVE where for four days there would be local bands and solo musicians play all day long. The last day we decided to attend and Shag Rock happened to be playing. We stayed for their whole set and I began listening to them throughout my entire trip there and on the way home.
