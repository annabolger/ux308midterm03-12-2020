Small-Town Strip Club made their debut EP release on January 20th of 2020. They are a rock band from the small-town of Stratford, Ontario. They have surpassed 10,000 streams on Spotify in the short few months they have been live on Spotify. 

This is my brother's band who formed about 4 years ago by playing small events and parties in Stratford, Ontario for their friends from high school. Once they started realizing they could make a name for themselves, they started setting themselves up with larger gigs and pormoting themselves to alrger venues. They made their Toronto debut at the Horseshoe Tavern where The Rolling Stones, The Tragically Hip, and The Police have all played in the past. The two songs on the EP are called Climb These Heights (which is my personal favourite) and Ends Meet. My brother plays the base in the band and I know the rest of the band from going to highschool with them - Jack Byan on guitar, Jim Flood on drums, and Johann Yundt on vocals.
