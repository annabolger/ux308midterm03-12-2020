Lime Coridale is a newer band from Sydney, Australia who specializes in the genre of surf rock. This is the first full album from Lime Cordiale and it was released in October of 2017.

I discovered Lime Cordiale through Spotify when I got home from Australia. Spotify's algorithms noticed I was listening to a lot of Shag Rock (being in the same surf-rock genre) so they recommended Lime Cordiale to me. This album reminds me of my life altering adjustment back into the real-world when I got home from my vacation to Australia. I started living my life more simply and trying to be most conscious and intentional in my everyday actions and interations with poeple and the planet overall. This music represents this time in my life and is a great reminder of the mindset I like to be in.
