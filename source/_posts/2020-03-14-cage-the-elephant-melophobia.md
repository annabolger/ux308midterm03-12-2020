Cage the Elephant released this album back in 2013 and had a large influence on the alternative music genre, specifically alternative rock. This album is one that is still being discovered by fans who are newly introduced to the alternative msuic genre.



This album was shown to me by my older brother who is actually in a band called Small-Town Strip Club (who is also featured as a separate post). He is the base player in his band and so he tendst to approceiate music with a good base line that he could practice with. This is one of his favourite albums and so when I began listneing to alternative music, he suggested this band to me. My favourite song from the album is the called Cigarette Daydreams. This album lead me to Cage the Elephant's other albums along with more alternative rock artists.
