Khalid has been one of the most influential R&B artists in the current music industry. The American Teen album was released in 2017 and was Khalid's debut solo album.

I discovered the American Teen album at the beginning of my first year at university. I met friends who were big fans of Khalid so they introduced me to him as an artist through this album. I was instantly in love with Khalid's sound as it is very distinct. This album reminds me of my first year and residence at the university whenever I hear it. I had the incredible opportunity to see this album in concert - this was one of the most memorable concerts I've ever been to. It was at RBC Echo Beach over the summer and the weather was doing some questionable things leading up to the night of the concert. By the time we got into the venue we made it up to the front of the stage and it began to rain. the ocncert appeared to be cancelled until 2 hours later Khalid came out on stage and stopped the crew who was packing up to start playing in the rain. He played straight through the rain and everyone who stayed was soaked to the bone but having an amazing time. Khalid puts on a very memorable show.
