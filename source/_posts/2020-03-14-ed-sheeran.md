Ed Sheeran is a world record breaker with his third album Divide. This album consists of 16 records that are all unique in sound and style of music.

I became an Ed sheeran fan back in 2014. He released his album Multiply in June fo 2014 and this is the album that hooked me to him as an artist. I became obsessed with his music and I now to this date, I have seen him in concert a total of 5 times. I was lucky enough to sit four rows from the stage with my Mom at his largest Canadian stadium show ever (at the Rogers Centre in Toronto). My Mom and I (as huge fans of Ed Sheeran) have travelled to Buffalo to see him perform as well. I would say that this music has had a very large influence on my future as a music fan. Ed Sheeran as a person has taught me a lot about being a humble human being and I feel as though I owe a lot of my teenage years to him as an artist.
